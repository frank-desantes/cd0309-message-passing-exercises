We want to implement the following functionality:

    Place an order for a computer
    Get all computer orders

When a user orders a computer, we want to allow users to specify equipment such as a keyboard or a webcam to include with the order.

An order should contain information on the user who created the order, the status of the order, the time the order was placed, and additional equipment.
